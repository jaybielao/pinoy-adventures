## Testing

- __Validator__
	- HTML
		- HTML code was meticulously validated via direct input using the W3C validator, ensuring compliance with web standards.
	- CSS
		- CSS stylesheet underwent thorough validation with the Jigsaw validator, guaranteeing consistency and reliability in style rendering.

**Known Issues**

While no major bugs were encountered during testing, minor adjustments was required to optimise performance on bigger devices or browsers.  

**Some issues were:**
- Straggling "\" was flagged by the validator. They were located mainly on the top part of the HTML.  Found out they were created during creating my Boilerplate HTML with the help of Emmet.

- My own issue with coding where I would loose track of ideas and get distracted with another section of the project and continue coding there.  I will need a better planning and take time in creating my next project a section at a time.
